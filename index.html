      Lemon Meringue Pie is made with a flaky all-butter crust, a creamy and
      tart lemon filling, and a light meringue topping. It is a fantastic citrus
      dessert that is a real treat because it is a three-step recipe that takes
      time, care, and technique. The result is a mouth watering pie that looks
      and tastes amazing! lemon meringue pie slice on plate Why This Recipe
      Works: Lemon meringue pie is a favorite dessert around here. It has
      everything a citrus dessert should have. The lemon filling I made is
      perfectly tart, in my opinion, but my husband thought it was a bit much.
      For me, I want my lemon desserts to be sour enough to make me salivate,
      but sweet enough to need another bite! This recipe is a labor of love. You
      can always lessen the amount of work by buying a pre-made pie crust, but
      for me there's nothing better than a homemade all-butter pie crust. The
      lemon filling takes time because you have to juice and zest the lemons,
      then mix the ingredients, then gently cook so they thicken. The meringue
      requires care to perfectly mix it so that soft, pillowy peaks can be
      formed. All said and done, this recipe is really not that difficult to
      make. You just need to know what to look out for. There are definitely a
      few steps you should and shouldn't take while making a homemade lemon
      meringue pie. toasted peaks on a meringue pie Do You Bake A Lemon Meringue
      Pie? Yes, but the process might be different than what you might guess.
      Lemon meringue pie requires a pre-baked pie crust. This can happen by
      purchasing a pre-baked shell at the store. Albeit, this is definitely the
      easiest option, it's not the tastiest. The next option would be to
      purchase a pre-made pie crust at the store and to bake it yourself. The
      final option would be to make a crust from scratch and then to bake it. I
      chose to make my all-butter pie crust. The only issue was that all-butter
      pie crusts shrink when they bake, so I chose to bake it upside down in
      hopes that my crust still looked like it could hold pie filling (not a
      disc) once baked. After you cook the lemon filling and whip up the
      meringue topping, you will bake the entire pie. This step is required to
      give the meringue that tasty and gorgeous golden brown layer. The heat
      from the oven, along with the heat from the hot lemon filling, is what
      cooks the topping. What Does It Taste Like? Heaven. It tastes like pure
      heaven. Oh, you want more detail? Well, if you've never enjoyed lemon
      meringue pie, allow me to explain. Each and every bite has three different
      textures and three different tastes. The crust provides something for you
      to chew on as well as a rich, buttery pastry flavor. The lemon filling is
      smooth and creamy. It packs a real punch with the tart lemon flavor but
      has enough sugar to leave a sweet taste resonating in your mouth. The
      meringue topping is light and fluffy. It melts in your mouth. The
      sweetness of the meringue balances out the sour from the lemon. And the
      part of the topping that turned golden brown tastes like a toasted
      marshmallow.
